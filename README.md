Week 1 assignment - Company splash page

## TIPS

Use the full relative path to link your files:

```
html

<link rel="stylesheet" href="../Week-01-assignment/style.css" >
./ = the current location folder
../ = the parent folder

```

bash

./images/imagename
images/test.jpg

```

git (Bertie's comment)

Git is a file managing system and github is a cloudstorage of git repositories (folders).
This means that all of your local changes stay local until you push the changes to the connected github repository.

To add changes to your local git repository you need to use the git add XX (which is often just git add .) this command selects what files and folders you want to track with git. To save the changes to these tracked files to your local git repository you need to use the git commit -m "XXXX" command (git commit -m "adding styles to the header") the message that goes in the speach marks is up to you but should be reflective of the changes you have made. You can then run the git push command to push your locally saved files to any connected online repository.

There are a lot more git commands and lots of different ways of using them but these are your core commands along with git status (this is used to see what is untracked what is tracked and if anything isn't commited)

All of these git commands are done on the command line:
-> git add . //adds the folder to GitHub
-> git commit -m "XXXXX" //the message accompanying the commit
-> git push // pushes the changes to the cloud

```
