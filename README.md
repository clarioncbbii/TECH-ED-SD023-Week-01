Week 1 assignment - Company splash page

# TIPS

Use the full relative path to link your files:

```
html

<link rel="stylesheet" href="../Week-01-assignment/style.css" >
./ = the current location folder
../ = the parent folder
```

```
bash

./images/imagename
images/test.jpg
```

```
git (Bertie's comment)

Git is a file managing system and github is a cloudstorage of git repositories (folders).
This means that all of your local changes stay local until you push the changes to the connected github repository.

To add changes to your local git repository you need to use the git add XX (which is often just git add .) this command selects what files and folders you want to track with git. To save the changes to these tracked files to your local git repository you need to use the git commit -m "XXXX" command (git commit -m "adding styles to the header") the message that goes in the speach marks is up to you but should be reflective of the changes you have made. You can then run the git push command to push your locally saved files to any connected online repository.

There are a lot more git commands and lots of different ways of using them but these are your core commands along with git status (this is used to see what is untracked what is tracked and if anything isn't commited)

All of these git commands are done on the command line:
-> git add . //adds the folder to GitHub
-> git commit -m "XXXXX" //the message accompanying the commit (label your message w/ 'chore', 'feat', 'bug fix', etc.)
-> git push // pushes the changes to the cloud

```

# ASSIGNMENT REFLECTION

REQUIRED

- What requirements did you achieve?
  I managed to address all the user stories I believe. I think I've built a cohesive website, with clear sections that a screenreader could interact with. The layout and navigation is responsive and I met all the visual cues outlined in the brief. The required tools e.g. flexbox, absolute positioning, etc. were employed to achieve the result.

- Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
  In the stretch goals I did not manage to get the audio to play, though I did get the audiplayer implemented and positioned where I wanted it.
  I also did not manage to get my social media links to spread out on the left side of the footer no matter how much I tweaked it.
  However, I am quite chuffed that I got a back to top button in; smooth scrolling; hover effect; footer with icons and background music in a way.
  My back to top button also seems to not be working, despite anchoring it to the top of the page; perhaps where I inserted the code is wrong... still unsure!
  I really tried to challenge myself for this first one.

- If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
  Bug fixing in general; although I managed to resolve every error I encountered during the build.
  Knowing whether I have reduntant code anywhere is also hard to know; have I gone overboard in places?

OPTIONAL
Feel free to add any other reflections you would like to share about your submission, for example:

\*Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission.
I would like to know if I have the required level of proficiency in HTML and CSS, so at least I know I have those two fundamentals under the belt. Even though I have much more to learn about those two languages, if I am at least mildly proficient at this stage, I can shift my brainpower onto JS fully.
Also, was much of my CSS code redundant or did I put in exactly what was needed?
In essence, I ask that you give me the most detailed feedback possible within the time you have so I really know where I stand.

\*What useful external sources helped you complete the assignment (e.g Youtube tutorials)?
MDN/W3Schools/TechStacker/GeeksForGeeks/Google/CSS-Tricks but also the code-along files from Manny's demos during the week; I even went back to my CodePen from my taster session to find something.

What errors or bugs did you encounter while completing your assignment? How did you solve them?
Gosh ... a lot! Mostly to do with syntax - in the end I resolved them all by following the errors on screen and logically walking back my steps.

What went really well and what could have gone better?
I outlined my HTML structure with pencil and paper before coding and that helped me get the general gist of the order down.
I had to take some time to look into the difference between a section and a div and though I think I get it ... I am not 1000% sure lol.
Lastly, I coded the whole thing start to finish in one sitting (because I get obsessed with things sometimes) - I could have probably done with more breaks in between for health and mental clarity.

THANK YOU :)
